#  Updated from Docushare Collection 1777, March 2012. This update includes an update to the detector & the mirror surfaces.

The throughput curves in this directory should be considered 
'baseline' for the current behavior of LSST. 

Note that these throughput curves are subject to change as our knowledge
of the LSST systems improve and prototypes become available. 

m1.dat, m2.dat, m3.dat represent the current mirror throughputs used in the SRD.
lens1.dat, lens2.dat, lens3.dat represent the current lens throughputs ""
detector.dat is the current detector sensitivity in the SRD.

filter_u / g / r / i / z / y. dat represent the current filter (filter only!) 
  throughput curves used in the SRD. Note that y = y4 is the current baseline filter. 

atmos_std.dat is the standard atmospheric bandpass at X=1.2

total_*.dat throughput curves represent the combination of all components in the LSST 
  system - mirrors, lenses, filter, detector, and the zenith atmos_std.dat atmosphere. 

All curves are in nanometers, with throughput represented by a number between 0 and 1.
