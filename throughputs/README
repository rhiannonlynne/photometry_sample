For "normal" LSST baseline evaluations, use the files in "baseline".

 y4 is (for now) being used as the baseline y filter, so is also
 linked to simply 'y' in this directory.  
 Note that while this is our current baseline performance,
 it represents our current idealized view of LSST behavior and does
 not include degradation of performance over time or with various
 contaminants.


Megacam and sdss should be self-explanatory, but hold total system
throughputs for megacam and SDSS, as published by those telescopes.

The directory 'atmos' contains various airmass atmospheres.

More information is available in README files within each directory.

If you are only concerned with calculating expected magnitudes for LSST
in various bandpasses, then you really only need the 'baseline' throughputs.
